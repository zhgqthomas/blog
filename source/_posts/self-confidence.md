Recently, I was in charge of recruiting new members for our company. So I read lots of resumes and interviewed a few people. They always like to ask, What is it that I have to do? What are you looking for? I would say:"Well, what are you really good at doing?That's what we'd be interested in" And typically their answers are,well, "I'm good at programming and math.I've built this app or that website in college or in my last company." But to be quite honest with you, those are the last things I'm looking for. The most important thing? Self-confidence. Without that skill, and I use the word skill intentionally. Without that skill, we're almost useless in any profession，as a teacher, a programmer or whoever you want to be. Because when you lose sight of or belief in yourself, you're done.

Maybe some of you wonder how can you tell a person has confidence or not based on just an interview? Well, actually it's not so hard. You can tell in their walk, in the way they greet people, in the way they behave in a meeting. Acutally there's one very important thing during the interview. A proper handshake. A handshake not only shows the confidence，but also it reveals the personality of the person giving it. For example, a soft handshake can indicate insecurity, whilst a quick-to-let-go handshake can suggest arrogance. So having a firm handshake is important for making a good impression.

Then what is self-confidence? I believe the definition of self-confience to be the ability or the belief to believe in yourself, to accomplish any task, no matter the odds, no matter the difficulties, no matter the adversity. The belief that you can accomplish it. Self-confidence. Some of you might say:"Great, I don't have it. I'm so shy, I'll never do that, bla bla bla". And you start to drag all the way down. But I use the word skill, Because I believe it can be trained. And I'll show you a couple of ways in which I do it. There's no magic button. I can't say:"Hey, this plane is going down, who can fly? Put your hand up." "I can, I'm confident!" No. It doesn't work that way. The easiest way to build self-confience. Repetition, Repetition, Repetition!

We expect to be self-confident, but we can't be unless the skill, or the task we're doing is novel, is new to us. We want to be in a situation where we have so much pressure and what I mean is that pressure builds diamonds. We want to be in a situation where we could say:"Hey, I've done this a thousand times."

Kobe Bryant, the famous NBA star. Once when asked by a reporter about the secret of his success, Kobe asked the reporter,"Do you know what Los Angeles looks like at 4 o’clock in the morning?" And for more than 10 years, he got up at 4 o'clock in the morning and went to do extra training. When Kobe first entered NBA, he was not among the most outstanding players, But now he has an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award, five NBA championships because of his ability to practice over and over, and over again. The problem with repetition is how many of us bail after the first bit of failure? How many of us bail after the first bit of adversity? Maybe it isnt repetition, maybe the answer should be persistence. Because we all repeat something but very few of us really persist in repeating it. So that's one way to build self confidence. Get out there. Do what you want to do and do not accept no!

The other one is self-talk. We all have a self-talk tape that plays in our head. Anybody went shopping and put on a pair of pants last weekend? If you're a woman, the first thing that always comes:"Damn I look fat in those pants." But if you're a man, it goes the opposite, oh god, I got no muscle, I'm so flabby! Right? We all have this negative self-talk that goes in our head. Guess what? There's enough people who are telling us we can't do it. That we're not good enough. Why do we want to tell ourselves that? Stop the negative self-talk.

There is one person very good at this. And eveybody knows him. Donald Trump! Believe it nor not, he is a very confident man. Why? If without confidence, he couldn't win the general election against democratic rival Hillary Clinton. And He will not become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency. I still remember his slogan for running the general election. "I'll make America great again!" Him, not her, it's him! Only him can make America great again. he is a businessman his whole life, he has never been a politician before. And this guy becomes the president-elect of the United States. He is scheduled to take office as the 45th President this Friday. I bet he talks to himself every day,"I, Donald Trump can make America great again!"

If I could give you one thing to take from this. It is no one will believe in you unless you do. We're supposed to be different, folks. And when people look at us, believe in yourself. Thank you.
